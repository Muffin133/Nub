        <p> Football was invented in China nearly 476 B.C.
 Football is the most watched and most played sport on earth.
 Only Canadians and Americans call football as Soccer.
 During every game, Football players run an average of 9.65 km.
 The first game of Basketball was played with a soccer ball.

            There were various variations of the original game that were made as it spread towards Japan and Korea. During these variations, more new features were added to the game, including placing a goal post right in the middle of the field.

Later, as the game started getting more and more recognition, and as more professional players started to join the sport, recognizable football goal posts were added as part of the game.
The game of football received its name not because the ball is kicked with the foot, but because it is a sport that is played on foot. In the earlier days, the peasants would play almost all their sports on foot while those of a higher social status played their sport on horseback. As a result, the games that were played on foot were referred to as football.

            Some of the earliest forms of the game of football that were played in England were played between neighboring villages and towns. The players often used an animal bladder instead of a proper ball. The animal bladder was first inflated, and players had to move the ‘ball’ to one particular area that used to be decided in advance. For instance, the players would be required to move the ball to the village green of the opponent team or the church of the opponent team. There were barely any rules in place, and any number of players could join in the game, as a result of which it often became very difficult to follow any rules or proper way of playing. Such games soon came to be known as ‘mob football.’

            Andrew Watson is known as the first international black football player and is also the first non-white football player who was featured in the FA Cup. Andrew was born in Guiana and was a major celebrity during the Victorian era when he won three Cups for the team of Scotland in the 1880s.
The word soccer originated in England. In the beginning, the term ‘Association Football’ was shortened to ‘Assoc Football’, which was then again shortened to the term ‘soccer.’ During the 19th century, it was a popular culture in England to add the ‘-er’ sound to any shortened word. <br>
